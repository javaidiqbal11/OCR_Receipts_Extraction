The receipt text provided is rather disjointed and includes different languages and unrelated characters. However, here's the important information that can be extracted:

1. A watch was purchased.
2. Brosse Col (3 items), which may refer to 3 color brushes, were bought.
3. Deo Men Degree 3, a type of deodorant for men, was also acquired.
4. Dent Tfriece Col 6199, difficult to decipher but may refer to a specific type of toothpaste or dental product.
5. Halfway down, a total is mentioned, but the actual numerical total is not provided.
6. There is reference to the PC Optimum program (PC Optimum 200/00, Rabats PC Optimum 100;00), implying some form of a rewards or loyalty program participation.
7. There is a mention of an invoice number (VOQ #: 1231618610)
8. A possible store or brand name might be Pharmapri.
9. There's an indication of a customer survey (AU SONDAGE CLIENT). The customer may use the number 800-701-9163 to call for the survey or give feedback. There also seems to be some kind of reward associated with the survey.
10. A potential product or serial number: 01308108-27501394.

Please note this is the best interpretation I can make given the lack of proper structure and context.
